# Leetcode-Master-Book
A review book for all the leetcode questions I have attempted. All codes are stored in master branch. 

This repo acts as my records for the leetcode journey that I am embarking. I have categorized the problems I attempted; each file under will have copied the instructions of the question and followed by a nicely commented solution code. 

As of June 2021, I am attempting all of my leetcode questions in Java because it is a language that I am more familiar with, and I will potentially switch to Python (also another language I'm familiar with but not as much as Java) when I encounter more complex questions like graphs. 

I have a study plan for the summer as following: 

1. HashMap 
2. LinkedList
3. Stack / Heap, PriorityQueue
4. Graph, BFS, DFS
5. Tree, BT, BST
6. Dynamic Programming
7. Sliding window  
8. Binary search
9. Recursion
10. Sort
11. Greedy + Backtracking
12. Math

Out of all the topics listed above, I am least familiar wiht Garph, Trees, Sliding window, and Dynamic Programming. I will continue my study journey with the aid of 
"Cracking the Coding Interview".

I have completed 3 easy questions, 4 medium questions, and 0 hard questions.
